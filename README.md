I am a postdoctoral fellow specializing in microbial bioinformatics and ecology at ArrietaLab in the Cumming School of Medicine at the University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. I hold a Ph.D. in Biology and a DESS (diplôme d'études supérieures spécialisées) in bioinformatics from the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), Montréal, Québec, Canada. My doctoral research focused on the drivers of plant and soil microbiome diversity and composition in agro-ecosystems and their variation in response to perturbations. This work was funded by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. I also have an M.Sc. in Horticulture from the University of Tehran, Iran, where I studied the genetic diversity of Iranian Basil populations. I am interested in environmental effects on microbiomes, host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions, and the drivers of microbial community assembly across environments, including humans, plants, and soil. I address these objectives by applying ecological theory and employing various high-throughput sequencing approaches, including metabarcoding and meta'omics.

Other than research, I enjoy cooking new recipes, traveling and living in different places around the world, learning about different cultures and languages, and exploring the integration of science and art.
